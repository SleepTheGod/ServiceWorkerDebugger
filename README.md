# XSS.IS Service Worker Debugger
Made By Taylor Christian Newsome

# How To Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SleepTheGod/ServiceWorkerDebugger
cd ServiceWorkerDebugger
chmod +x main.sh
sudo bash main.sh
```

# What this script does
This Bash script performs a series of operations related to testing and simulating service worker behavior, including displaying ASCII art and debug information. It first prints a customized ASCII art logo with a message. The script then defines a URL for a service worker script and includes functions to check if this service worker is accessible by making an HTTP request, displaying debug logs both locally and from the service worker, and simulating the registration of the service worker. It also checks cache behavior by attempting to fetch specific cache routes. After executing these tasks, it prints a completion message. The script is a simulation of service worker functionality, as true service worker registration and operations are meant to be handled by a browser's JavaScript environment, not by a Bash script.
